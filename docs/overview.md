# Elegant Documentation

Elegant is a C library inspired by Haskell, designed to bring Haskell-like functional programming paradigms to the C language. It provides a set of macros and pure functions to enable functional programming features in C, making it easier to write code in a functional, declarative style.

## Features

- **Haskell-like Functional Programming Macros**: Macros to simplify writing functional code in C, inspired by Haskell's syntax and idioms.
- **Pure Functions**: A collection of pure functions that avoid side effects and make code more predictable.
- **Immutability Support**: Tools and patterns to encourage immutable data handling.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Support for passing functions as arguments and returning functions from other functions.
- **Function Composition, Currying, and Partial Application**: Utilities to enable advanced function manipulation, similar to Haskell.
- **Map, Filter, Reduce**: Implementations of common functional operations for arrays and collections.
- **Declarative and Expressive Style**: Encourages a declarative approach to problem solving in C, similar to Haskell.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Add the Elegant source files to your C project.
2. **Include the Header**: `#include "elegant.h"`
3. **Use Functional Macros and Functions**: Start using the provided macros and functions to write Haskell-like functional C code.
