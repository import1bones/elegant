# elegant

Elegant is a C library that brings Haskell-like functional programming features to the C language.

Elegant provides a set of macros and pure functions to make C support many of the features found in functional programming languages, especially those inspired by Haskell. It enables you to write C code in a functional, declarative style.

## Features

- Haskell-like functional programming macros and idioms
- Pure functions and immutability support
- Higher-order functions (functions as arguments and return values)
- Function composition, currying, and partial application
- Map, filter, reduce, and other collection operations
- Declarative and expressive code style

See the documentation in `docs/overview.md` for more details and examples.
