Elegant Functional Programming Library - NEWS
===========================================

## Version 0.0.1 (2025-08-04)

### Initial Release

This is the first release of the Elegant functional programming library for C.

#### Features Implemented

- **Core Functional Operations**
  - MAP operations for int, float, double types
  - FILTER operations with predicate functions  
  - REDUCE operations with accumulator functions
  - Array creation and manipulation functions

- **Memory Management**
  - Automatic memory management with scope-based cleanup
  - Stack arena allocation (default mode)
  - Reference counting mode for shared data
  - Memory usage tracking and debugging

- **Array Operations**
  - Safe array access with bounds checking
  - Array length, reverse, slice operations
  - Type-safe array creation macros

- **Build System**
  - Professional GNU Autotools build system
  - Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows, *BSD)
  - pkg-config integration for easy linking
  - Configurable debug and example builds
  - Comprehensive test suite

- **Type System**
  - C99 compatible implementation
  - GCC statement expressions for inline operations
  - __typeof__ support for type inference
  - AUTO macro for automatic type deduction

- **Documentation**
  - Comprehensive API documentation
  - Working example programs
  - Installation and usage guides
  - Cross-platform build instructions

#### Examples Included

- **functional_demo.c**: Demonstrates core MAP/FILTER/REDUCE operations
- **basic_examples.c**: Shows basic usage patterns and memory management
- Working test suite validates functionality

#### Platform Support

- Linux (tested on Ubuntu/Debian)
- macOS (with Xcode command line tools)
- Windows (MSYS2/MinGW-w64)
- FreeBSD/OpenBSD (native support)

#### Dependencies

- C99-compatible compiler (GCC 4.9+, Clang 3.5+)
- GNU Autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool)
- Standard C library and libm

#### Installation

Standard autotools workflow:
```
./configure --enable-debug --enable-examples
make
make check
sudo make install
```

#### Known Limitations

- Maybe/Either types are partially implemented
- Some advanced functional features are still in development
- Generic FILTER/MAP macros have type restrictions

#### Future Plans

- Complete Maybe/Either type implementation
- Enhanced error handling
- More functional programming primitives
- Performance optimizations
- Extended type system support

This release provides a solid foundation for functional programming in C with automatic memory management and a professional build system.
